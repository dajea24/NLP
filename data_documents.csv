cricket,england fail to finish job again england have done their best throughout this series to suggest that they are vulnerable and on rainhit third day at centurion their batsmen did it again when michael vaughan horribly mispulled shaun pollock to square leg for fourball duck england had lost three tame wickets for two runs in three overs they seemed to be doing their best to keep the game open when they should have been doing their utmost to close it down the first to go was marcus trescothick who was run out thanks to misjudgement by andrew strauss trescothick at the nonstriker end responded to strauss call when he drove makhaya ntini to straight mid off but strauss suddenly changed his mind and as trescothick tried desperately to regain his ground nicky boje swooped onehanded and threw the stumps down direct robert key fell three overs later when he was caught behind down the leg side for single key glared at umpire bucknor when he raised his finger and dragged himself off the ground but replays suggested that he had indeed touched the ball four balls later vaughan was caught and england were reeling on andrew strauss then appeared completely to lose touch and frankly graham thorpe has only very occasionally been in form throughout the series the lefthanders scratched about barely laying bat on ball but somehow they survived despite some very close lbw appeals they managed to add between the interruptions until strauss uncharacteristically chased ball well wide of his off stump from andre nel and edged to boucher for moments later lightening drove the players from the ground time is ticking away now and with just two days to go it would take something remarkable for the south africans to win the match from here but england fallibility and their growing tendency to allow the opposition second chance is something that should concern their supporters everyone is anticipating close exciting ashes series in the summer but being completely honest england will have to improve enormously on their efforts on this tour even to come close to threatening the aussies 
cricket,england require extra intensity batsman graham thorpe has acknowledged that england need to raise their game ahead of the first test against south africa which starts on friday the team have arrived in port elizabeth after being given wakeup call in sevenwicket loss to south africa we lacked intensity and we need to rise to the level south africa will be at thorpe commented we re fraction short of where we need to be and some of us will need to scrap really hard in the first test former england seam bowler angus fraser has criticised an itinerary which gave the team just single firstclass match ahead of the test series even though most of the team had not played since september in an ideal world the batsmen would have liked to have spent more time at the crease but it important that we don get down on ourselves we re going to have dig deep into the memory banks and remember the times we ve done well against them said thorpe who faced just balls in potchefstroom in making and the good thing about not spending too long at the crease is that don know whether m in bad form or not the surrey lefthander england most experienced player with tests says the team must keep their nerve the key is not to panic too much and find the right balance between enjoyment and wanting to win you need to put your state of mind into position where you re going to enjoy the match but you re going to be competitive you have to be able to enjoy the challenge because it not always bed of roses out there you re not always creaming it around so part of it is enjoying the challenge of maybe feeling little bit more under pressure and wanting to perform south africa meanwhile have seen their preparations disrupted by clutch of illnesses and injury problems skipper graeme smith batsman boeta dippenaar and allrounders andrew hall and zander de bruyn have been suffering from stomach problems since the recent tour to india and wicketkeeper thami tsolekile has been trying to shake off throat infection more worrying however is the fitness of spin bowler nicky boje who recently underwent surgery to remove tumour from his neck they are likely to give him as long as possible to recover before finalising their test xi we re still working with him it a daybyday process said team physio shane jabaar

cricket,england victory tainted by history as england attempt to secure series victory in south africa they will do so at the venue for previous match which became the stuff of test cricket folklore south africa meeting with england at centurion park in january was thought to have been an enthralling spectacle with the tourists claiming remarkable win after three whole days were lost to bad weather it took few short months to reveal the unfortunate truth that bookmaker had given home skipper hansie cronje money and leather jacket to influence the outcome of the match cronje who was killed two years later in plane crash was subsequently found guilty of matchfixing and banned from test cricket for life opening the bowling for england was andy caddick who told bbc sport they were up in the series we had lot of english supporters there and south africa just wanted to make game of it that what thought at the time you don think anything of it but then afterwards you start to put two and two together with events that happened afterwards england captain nasser hussain put the south africans in after winning the toss and was given an early reward of purely cricketing nature when gary kirsten edged darren gough to second slip for duck in the first over cronje also fell to gough for duck as the home side closed the first day the next three days were then wiped out competely due to combination of rain and damp ground conditions before cronje approached hussain with suggestion to manufacture result south africa had already secured the series having won in johannesburg and cape town but cronje and his friends wanted to create some interest in the final day at centurion the idea was for each side to forfeit an innings each leaving the tourists with run chase so south africa reached on the final morning to set england from overs kirsten was one of several players opposed to the move as he explained to bbc sport hansie came up to us in the changing room on the last day and said m keen to forfeit the innings and set the total he asked the team and there was mixed reception some of the guys felt we didn want to give england chance of winning you don mess around with test matches and some said nothing hansie just decided and maybe we know why in hindsight to go for it but there was quite bit of resistance and some of the guys didn think it was good idea at all england th man that day was phil tufnell who recalled everyone thought it was very good gesture in the spirit of the game the game had meandered along and all of sudden it was like an old fashioned threeday county game and we were having chase whatever the reasons later it emerged that cronje part had been simply to ensure against draw it led to fascinating cricket match england needed six from the final seven balls and yorkshire tailenders chris silverwood and darren gough both hit boundaries to give them twowicket victory it ended as great day for cricket kirsten conceded one could argue it was good for people who had been frustrated having not watched any cricket and suddenly got great last day but from player point of view you ve worked so hard for three months trying to win test series that you don give test matches away or create the opportunity to make it easy to win one tufnell has favourable memories of cronje who played county cricket for leicestershire in the he always came across as nice bloke the spinner said he always came and said hi and seemed very intelligent captain good competitor and good ambassador for south african cricket kirsten too recalls some positive images of cronje we all know that what he did cannot be condoned in any circumstances he said but my view is he did huge amount for my career thought he was an outstanding captain and ve made mistakes in my life so m not in position to be judgemental

not finding the middle of the bat but smearing through vacant midon for single after the pace barrage boje returns and hoggard finds single to leave new man simon jones on strike the giles vigil ends in disappointing fashion as severely hampered he hooks at steyn and the man at deep squareleg does not have to move favouring the back foot as steyn continues to steam in hoggard is glad to see one of fullish length that he can push out for single after single is scrambled hoggard moves into the firing line and just manages to avoid rapidly rising bouncer another part of unprotected giles anatomy is battered at mph steyn skidding short one catching him in the armpit hoggard jabs down at the final moment to keep out yorker from kallis that was destined for the timbers an appeal begun only by the keeper for caught behind against giles down the legside increases little in volume but darrel hair is not impressed hoggard does not know too much about full and fast delivery which he inside edges to fineleg for single giles hooks uncomfortably again with one hand off the bat but the single gives him temporary reprieve from the hostile steyn the return of kallis is warmly greeted by giles who clips loosener neatly off his pads for four matthew hoggard is the latest casualty another short one from the aggressive steyn thwacking into his arm guard the next ball is also short and giles plays an unconvincing hook with one hand coming off the bat but some contact is made and giles is grateful to stutter through for single giles is thumped again by another short one giles ducks into brutal low bouncer from steyn the ball crashes into his elbow and loops over the slip for four leg byes steyn returns for pollock as south africa look to wrap up the innings the hook proves to be the undoing of jones who picks out rudolph in the deep off ntini jones edges low through gap where fourth slip would have been bringing four urgently needed runs for england another hook goes high into the space in front of square but determined fielding from rudolph restricts jones to two persisting with the hook shot jones is fully in control but can only get single to deep squareleg off pollock jones hooks uppishly at ntini and is within yards of carrying to the fielder on the fineleg boundary aiming an expansive drive into the offside he gets an inside edge and escapes with single jones pummels cut shot off pollock into the boards for his second four vaughan is rapped on the pads bang in front by skidding delivery from ntini and umpire taufel confirms his worst fears pollock unsettles vaughan with bouncer that follows him and catches the glove controlled thick edge from jones finds the gap between third slip and gully and races for four ntini returns his first delivery down the legside and easily turned for single by vaughan geraint jones picks up short one from pollock and the ball soars over the ropes for the maximum to open the wicketkeeper account in emphatic fashion vaughan rocks back to guide forcing shot for much needed boundary off boje flintoff is beaten for pace by pollock and his hook shot loops up tamely off the splice to square leg to leave his team in turmoil vaughan appears to lose sight of short one from pollock and having planned to leave it fends it awkwardly with the glove before scrambling through for risky single vaughan is able to pinch single as his gentle push on the off side defeats the fielder on the bounce thorpe is trapped plumb in front by the metronomic pollock boje resumes after the interval vaughan crashes one into jacques rudolph at silly point but slices the next ball through gully for four england vaughan and thorpe get through safely to lunch but know that much more will be required this afternoon vaughan badly needing to play major innings strikes fluent boundary off boje kallis switches ends and produces maiden as england look towards the safety of the luncheon interval new man graham thorpe clips single from the final ball of the over the single proves effective as key man strauss takes the strike and lofts catch to extra cover where ntini swoops low to cap fine morning for the home side boje finds some early spin with his third delivery and catches the edge of vaughan bat as the england captain pushes forward but de villiers spills the chance and the ball falls to safety kallis is replaced after two overs and the spin of nicky boje is tried minutes before lunch there is nothing to stop strauss cut shot which brings up the england in the th over strauss is denied certain boundary when his pull shot strikes squareleg umpire simon taufel kallis escapes with maiden as sumptuous looking drive from vaughan goes straight to the ubiquitous amla in the covers strauss strokes the next ball gloriously down the ground for his fourth boundary vaughan pirouettes to pull steyn stylishly but only for single as the distinctive figure of amla fields on the squareleg fence strauss eases the pressure little by bisecting the field with trademark drive to the boundary as kallis struggles to find his rhythm early on jacques kallis is introduced having been unable to bowl in the first test or in india his first delivery is easily clipped into the legside for vaughan first run more conviction in this pull shot from strauss and steyn is dispatched to the boundary just single from the over hook from strauss who moves to nine michael vaughan is given bouncer first up and survives an optimistic shout for lbw an inside edge onto the stumps off steyn ends butcher innings in disappointing fashion again nicely timed cover drive brings butcher three runs with the intrepid amla cutting the ball off yard inside the ropes ntini replaces pollock who is left to fume in the outfield his face light shade of crimson steyn completes his second maiden restricting butcher with an accurate offstump line pollock hurls the ball back at strauss and throws in few choice words for good measure the extra bounce of durban provides some uncertainty for strauss an attempted cut and hook bouncing too high for him dale steyn is brought into the attack and herschelle gibbs provides him with maiden with an agile diving stop in the gully butcher has to scamper through as he attempts quick single to amla who is quicker than perhaps the lefthander gives him credit for luckily for him the throw is fraction high an elegant drive on the tips of his toes from strauss through midoff gives him his first boundary mark butcher nudges ntini into the legside to open his account pollock maintains the south africa stranglehold with another over offering no easy runs stunning onehanded catch by de villiers off an inside edge ends trescothick bright innings strauss gets down to ntini end and is happy to receive ball on the pads which he clips neatly away through squareleg for three trescothick slashes wide one from ntini not quite out of the middle but there is enough on it to clear nicky boje in the gully and race for four strauss looks for single after driving to the right of hashim amla but the fielder gets across well and ensures another maiden the wild ntini produces maiden the final ball of the over keeping low and bouncing in front of wicketkeeper ab de villiers strauss keen to get off the mark attempts drive at pollock outside offstump but misses and it is another maiden ntini asks the question of darrell hair but trescothick is long way forward he clips the next ball off his pads for two more another probing maiden from pollock with strauss content to remain on nought and leave them outside his offstump trescothick thumps the final ball of ntini over through the covers into the boundary boards pollock maintains tidy line outside offstump to strauss who is yet to get off the mark trescothick picks the gap at midoff punching ntini for the day first boundary ntini bowling over the wicket angles short ball across trescothick who does not take the

athletics,european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well think we could be heading to the european championships with half dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton win in the hurdles running subeight seconds twice in week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up medal but what was great about sunday performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the men race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the men m hurdles is so strong think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of which puts him at the top of the world rankings had chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is good performance he is such huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board thought kelly sotherton had great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and hurdles and you can ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far she has complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasn all good news in sheffield thought both the races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasn at his best chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him he there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got big scalp out there in the women race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with chest infection if she had made the final think jeanette would have gone bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following twoyear drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by long way and that shouldn be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition think that would help her couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them

athletics,record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and would just love her to put us out of our misery and have go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and would like to see her have go at in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside thought it was very encouraging evening work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world top three runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is bit of benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadn got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look bit silly my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but haven seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france ronald pognon who has run seconds will be under threat at the europeans from british point of view sarah claxton victory in the hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women national race in new personal best of seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have very strong xm squad going to the european championships scotland lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have real prospect of medal from an international perspective thought meseret defar was disappointing in the but don think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year shape she would have given defar real run for her money she had go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting bit more from bernard lagat in the men m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and felt uncomfortable in the commentary box think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

rugby,all black magic new zealand rugby playing colours all black the haka and more the all blacks charles john munro discovered rugby at london christ college and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand first game nelson town met nelson college on may the town triumphing by two goals to nil instigating game that would become national obsession and come to dominate the country sporting passions the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread the native maoris finding particular empathy with the sport warrior ethos in british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia and soon after maori named joe warbrick and an english expat called thomas eyton decided to gather combined new zealand team twentytwo maori and four pakiha formed the new zealand native team who played total of matches in new zealand australia and the uk the integration of white and maori was reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the prematch tradition of the maori war dance the haka the other great symbol of new zealand rugby the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in new zealand played their first international against australia in the kiwis triumphing in sydney and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain david revell bedellsivright created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude the kiwis shocked the rugby world with triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedellsivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk their opportunity to prove him wrong came in with the first official new zealand tour to europe the tourists won their early games with quickthinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their scrum formation that left roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to win over scotland before ireland were despatched in dublin huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in hammering of england new zealand headed to wales to meet country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in series of controversial clashes between the sides an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed win in hardfought encounter at cardiff arms park but postmatch talk was dominated by bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas dallas said that deans was tackled short but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding try on his deathbed three years later he exclaimed did score that try in cardiff four of the all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglowelsh touring team in the first south africa tour of new zealand in saw honours shared in threetest series starting the greatest rivalry in rugby and the longrunning controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players the awesome all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all of their games in france britain and ireland including crushing victory over wales at st helen despite their success the all blacks scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in employing the modern scrum lineup against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn twoall the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the lions tour series won by new zealand the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum the all blacks european tour started inauspiciously with an loss to swansea side inspired by teenage schoolboy halfbacks hayden tanner and willie davies thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales although the winning try from geoffrey reesjones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the buildup new zealand next visit to wales in proved difficult as they lost to cardiff and drew at swansea the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park but the teams were locked at when clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for famous matchwinning try the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller new zealand built from that tour and by the time they returned in they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world that made the shock all the greater when drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely win over the tourists at rodney parade wilson whinneray side rallied to beat wales their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome tourists was draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team ferocious game at the arms park in was edged by the all blacks measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn jamesinspired lions of james guided llanelli to famous win over the tourists at stradey park though and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks in cardiff in game regarded by many as the greatest ever played new zealand defeated wales xv at the arms park in noncap game in but it was the game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries wales were leading with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from lineout television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for win since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game crushing win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union centenary game was sign of things to come the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside in brisbane in the semifinal of the inaugural world cup the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their illfated tour of new zealand young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them and after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he along with generation of wales best players chose to head north to rugby league win in cardiff followed for new zealand in and at the world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg crushing kiwi triumph in wembley followed in and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen there was temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff new millennium stadium in they left with victory bruising defeat followed for wales in hamilton in as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead early in the second half new zealand rallied to win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to better future they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with weakened squad at the end of long season an encouraging display against south africa has inspired confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over years they have chance but clearly history is not on their side

rugby,henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer the player who staked the biggest claim for place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson he very confident you just had to listen to his interview afterwards he beamed with confidence but although there an element of arrogance it good arrogance he certainly showed some nice touches he once showed clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand and that without even mentioning his majestic matchwinning penalty but think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test he needs to come up against brian driscoll or big french midfield wales flyhalf stephen jones was another player who impressed me he gave good direction he was very confident and he was nice general for his side he showed he can control game with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number shirt could be up for grabs and jones or maybe even henson could make the lions team at flyhalf jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday game some of the wales forwards surprised me because thought they would be outmuscled in the tight five england prop julian white is capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top however still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame some english players did their cause no harm thought joe worsley had solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and think it will be while before we see him again despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france tom smith has been there and done it before but the likes of chris cusiter jason white and ally hogg all made their mark hogg made couple of good runs while white had pretty robust game his defence is right up there cusiter looked very lively and he could be very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward the star of ireland win over italy in rome looks like certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand brian driscoll is class act he ran some good lines against italy made the breaks and fed his outside backs although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him gordon arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but think you could get henson arcy driscoll combination in the lions midfield paul connell just needs to add hard edge to his game and malcolm kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up while shane byrne seems to be lively character but they will be bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday although used to play in italy and know how difficult it can be one player who didn impress me was wales scrumhalf dwayne peel he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing they had good possession and he kicked the ball away wouldn want him as my lions scrumhalf after that

rugby,murphy that was bruising battle that what call tough game it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced we knew all along that we would be huge threat particularly the first game in the championship it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it m not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it bit on monday morning in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were little bit problematical the different interpretations between the referee and the players was little difficult but we managed to get the ball in our hands and got try near the end of the first half it always good to score it was great work by brian and always knew had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee eddie sullivan was very calm at halftime even though we were only ahead he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory that new ruck law made it bit more difficult to get out of our own half we were penalised lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break so really we went back to playing territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball every one was little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover it a big ask after such bruising encounter was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday it could so easily have gone their way but for couple of decisions we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us in the meantime when in rome

rugby,a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during year in irish rugby that stood out more than most well at least there used to one now there is handful to look back with mixture of satisfaction and sorrow it has been quite year for the irish and not just with eddie sullivan triple crown winning international outfit either right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game but most of the kudos will go to sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for years but also finished their autumn campaign with record for the second year in succession they also finished in the runnersup spot in the rbs six nations but in the three games in november which included victory over trinations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on high the victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer those two reverses and the flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent months but the big one of course was the defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf the winning try was conceived in sullivan mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey for me the try of the championship sullivan career is now in vertical takeoff mode it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galwaybased coach to head the lions test side not only that but fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand there can be no doubt that ireland representation will be the biggest ever albeit in proposed man squad in brian driscoll and paul connell ireland have now the two frontrunners for the captaincy gordon arcy whose career began as teenager back in finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well the under squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by powerful all black side in the decider the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runnersup to england in the six nations under tournament on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked good wager while ulster finished runnersup in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish looking to reach their third final they went down to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road how wasps recovered from that energysapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody guess ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first outings in the celtic league leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing on the down side irish rugby was hit by number of tragedies teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under world cup game in durban that happened only days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in the last time that goal had been achieved before this season ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of wellknown londonderry ym player jim huey coleraine jonathan hutchinson and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole they all passed away long before the fulltime whistle

rugby,paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been better six nations match than saturday epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to first grand slam since those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as whole after scintillating display in paris welsh legend mervyn davies member of two of three grand slamwinning sides of the hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades martyn williams wales twotry scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games have ever played in crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed there was french half and there was welsh half and what half it was for the red dragonhood transforming halftime deficit into an lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period but while that passage of play showed the swelling selfbelief of side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us whole lot more about this welsh side that they recovered from battering in the first halfhour to first stem the tide before halftime then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough but in resisting seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in nailbiting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on consistent basis england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in similar light but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline ten of the on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced in paris two years ago but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them great rugby nation in the first place the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer lions tour to new zealand and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve jones after his superb manofthematch display observed that we are very happy camp now ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad the joie de vivre so evident in that magical secondhalf spell in paris also stems from style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decisionmaking under pressure are equally important so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland only then with the visit of ireland to finish can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the and writing their own names into welsh legend

rugby,november to remember last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world that statement was made to look little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of richly entertaining autumn series the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australia triumph in london followed by france capitulation to new zealand clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about while that bodes well for rugby as whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for decade while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super matters in the new year europe finest have less than weeks before they return to the international fray and for the first time in more than decade it will not simply be straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title that owes much to ireland continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays who secured first triple crown in years last season could go one better and win their first fivesix nations title since they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland selfbelief while ronan gara late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie sullivan side can now close out tight games not that england or france who have won nine of the last six nations titles between them will lay down quietly dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper the narrow defeat to australia was timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of postworld cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff fourth title in six years is within reach are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style while south africa overconfidence in cardiff made for closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory if mike ruddock can coax reliable setpiece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february the last fortnight has left in state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with superb victory over australia stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency but the manner of new zealand demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that win over one of the major nations was imminent while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations lack of topclass players will continue to undermine their best efforts who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february

rugby,tigers wary of farrell gamble leicester say they will not be rushed into making bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester at the moment there are still lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation whoever does take him on is going to take big big gamble farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the man game if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells think england would prefer him to progress to position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in readymade replacement 
rugby,ireland win eclipses refereeing errors the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go bellyup it may have to go the whole way and have nflstyle video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sunday explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since the game was as exciting as it comes with muchimproved england side enraged at few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cueto first halfeffort when he went over in the corner from charlie hodgson kick england coach andy robinson referred to similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the minutes the referee also missed england danny grewcock taking out ronan gara off the ball to allow martin corry sunday stroll to the line those were the standout moments in classic game between the two old foes but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian driscoll winning try was as wellconceived as they come while charlie hodgson brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan gara tremendous ability to control the game was also crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickie brilliant double tackle in the righthand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson crossfield kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring certain try ireland secondrow colossus paul connell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into connell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for crucial turnover that spoke volumes about ireland backfoot display with defensive coach mike ford taking bow at the end to win game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships

rugby,dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout glittering international career even the end of his nineyear career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of sustained period of success for england dallaglio crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three backrow positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captain band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england teammate martin johnson he played massive role in the series victory but after building up seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglio career hit the buffers at speed in first came the lastminute defeat to wales in which dallaglio decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as lieutenant to new captain johnson as member of newlook england side on the long road to world cup glory journey not without mishaps as succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as key performer once again yet another setback arrived in as serious knee injury cut short dallaglio involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of england world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnson retirement dallaglio career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio second spell as captain losing five of their eight postworld cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio role as captain but it is as player that england will really struggle to replace the yearold although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no standout candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio massive influence on english rugby

and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any
